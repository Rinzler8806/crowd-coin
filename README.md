# Title: CrowdCoin

The app helps to add extra layers of transparency that is often cause for concern with websites such as kickstarter that rely on crowdsourcing to fund projects. Beginning at the home page, the user is able to create a campaign or view campaigns that have already been created. If viewing existing campaigns, you can see individual details about them, such as balance.

To participate in the campaigns you will need to open a Metamask wallet. You can download Metamask at the following link: https://metamask.io/download.html


The app utilizes React, NextJS, Semantic UI React, Truffle-HD Wallet, Mocha, NodeJS and Solidity.
